Discussion about integration:
    - Randomizer integration scenarios:
        1 Ideal scenario, ...
        2 Realistic scenario: treat map rando ...

Tell solver a starting location, and to try to reach a target location with a given set of Relics:
  Every time a potential Relic location is reached, split off to try every possible Relic
